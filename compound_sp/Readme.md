## Sample Islandora Compound Object Content

* Compound objects are typically metadata records that provide relationships between different objects.
* To create a compound object you can use the sample objects from the large_image_sp.
* Navigate to your Compound Collection
* Select Manage.
* Select Add an object to this Collection
* Select Islandora Compound Object Content Model
* Fill in the metadata form

Manage the object you just created. 

* Select the Compound button
* Add a Child Object PID/Label (eg. the front of the postcard)
* Submit
* Add another Child Object PID/Label (eg. the back of the postcard)
* If the back appears first ... you can Manage the object, select Compound, and Reorder as needed.
* The first child object serves as the source of the thumbnail for the compound object.

To view the compound object interface you need to enable the Islandora Compound Object Navigation block (admin/structure/block).
